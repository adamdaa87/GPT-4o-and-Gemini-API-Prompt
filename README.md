# GPT-4o-and-Gemini-API-Prompt
These scripts are designed for the testing and evaluation of coding models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. 
They manage the process of prompting and input processing, evaluating the generated solutions through unit tests, and measuring execution times. 
The scripts integrate with external APIs for both GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro to send prompts and retrieve responses, 
and conducting comprehensive testing on the responses. Together, 
they provide a streamlined workflow for assessing the correctness and efficiency of the LLM models' solutions.
