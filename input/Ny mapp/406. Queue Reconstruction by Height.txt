You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). 
Each people[i] = [h_i, k_i] represents the ith person of height h_i with exactly k_i other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h_i.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. 
The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, 
where queue[j] = [h_j, k_j] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

Constraints:
1 <= people.length <= 2000
0 <= h_i <= 106
0 <= k_i < people.length
It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

Start the Python code with:
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
