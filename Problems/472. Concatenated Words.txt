A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necessarily distinct) in the given array.

1 <= words.length <= 10^4
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.
1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 10^5
