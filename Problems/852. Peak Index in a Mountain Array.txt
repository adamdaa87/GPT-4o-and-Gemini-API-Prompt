You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

Constraints:
3 <= arr.length <= 10^5
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.

Start the Python code with:
class Solution:
    def peakIndexInMountainArray(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
